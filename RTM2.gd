###TODO###
#We have 9 types of rooms. Each type has it's own event.
# Events: encounter an weak/normal/strong/Boss enemy; find treasure, find a shop, find a forbidden room, fall into a trap, or an empty room
# Whenever the player's sprite enters a type empty room, another type of room will be randomly chosen and the event of that room will be triggered. Type = empty is among the possible random choices.Â 
# Introduce the random room assignment from RTM v1 and the specific event type triggering from RTMv1
# On version v2, instead of checking if the room is empty, we are checking if the room is of type "Quartz" (The type of room where nothing happens). Meaning, we don't need the "Empty?" custom data layer anymore.
